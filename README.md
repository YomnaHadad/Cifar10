# Cifar10
## MLP Vs CNN

1. **cifar_mlp.py file**
   as (MLP) model typically achieves an accuracy of around 45% to 60% on the CIFAR-10 dataset. \
   i built a mlp model with 4-hidden layers. \
   **achieving Accuracy: 0.5588 - loss: 1.2802**

   
2. **cifar_cnn.py file**
   building a simple CNN model with bunch of convolutional layes, normalization layers, and pooling layers \
   **achieving Accuracy: 0.8409 - loss: 0.5430**
